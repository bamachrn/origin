# This is the official OpenShift Origin pod infrastructure image. It will stay running
# until terminated by a signal and is the heart of each running pod. It holds on to
# the network and IPC namespaces as containers come and go during the lifetime of the
# pod.
#
# The standard name for this image is openshift/origin-pod
